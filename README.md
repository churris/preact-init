# preact-init
This tool is highly inspired by create-react-app and vue-cli and tries to merge good ideas from both approaches.

While both tools use Webpack with Babel to build bundles, preact-init instead uses a Rollup/Bublé mix that generates smaller and faster bundles.

If Rollup or Bublé aren't your thing, a Wepback's alternative can be found in preact-cli.
